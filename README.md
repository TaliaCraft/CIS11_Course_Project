# CIS11_Course_Project
Overview
This project's objective is to create a program in LC3 assembly language that accurately calculates and displays the maximum, minimum, and average from a set of five test scores provided by the user. Additionally, the program will assign a letter grade for each test score based on predefined grading criteria. This program aims to offer a quick and simple method for evaluating the statistics of test scores while ensuring accuracy and reliability. A key goal is to create a user-friendly interface that provides clear prompts for the user and returns accurate values.

~Features~
Input: Prompts the user to enter five test scores.
